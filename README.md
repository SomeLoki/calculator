# Odin - Calculator
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator


## Description
This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. The goal is to build a calculator that can add, subtract, multiple, or divide 2 numbers. 


## Core skills
- DOM Manipulation
- Event Handling
- State management
- Page Styling


## Challenge 1: Data Management
I think the hardest part was deciding how different data that would either be called frequently (variables that make up the display text), once or twice.
Ultimately to me it made sense to store the display as an object as it was all related and would allow me to use clear naming conventions, whereas for ojbect
arrays fit the purpose while still having clear names. 


## Challenge 2: Thinking like a calculator
It's easy to say a calculator takes x + y and performs z on them to get a total. But for example when creating a backspace function, I know the intent is 
to remove the last character.But what if the total is displayed? Do I want to remove a character from the total, or from the previous equation. Or what if you 
entered the first number, entered the operator but haven't started the second number? Or how do I decide what goes to the second number?


## Challenge 3: CSS and flexbox sizing
I swear flexbox doesn't always like doing what I think I am asking it to do with sizing. And sometimes it's hard to visually see why since there are multiple 
objects at play. 

## What I learned
-Build more time with debugging and stepping through functions with dev console.
-Improve naming conventions. 
-Building helper functions, and breaking larger functions down.
-Handling events.
